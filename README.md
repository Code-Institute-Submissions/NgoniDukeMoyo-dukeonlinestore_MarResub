The color scheme is more aimed at lighter colors to grab the interest and attention. There are a lot of whites, light blue and stanaderd back to contrast with the white.

# Testing 
1. A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all libraries are still appearing in the app as they kept on removing themselves.
Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues

# Further Testing
family and friends

# Performance Testing Test Cases
# Usability Testing Test Cases
# Compatibility Testing
# Browser Testing

# Bugs
1. Initially downloading django 4 but turns out it was not the appropriate version therefore some documentation was hard wired in the coge which cause the requirements like :
## pip3 install Django==3.2
## pip3 django-allauth==0.41.0
## pip3 install pillow 9.0.1
## pip3 install django-crispy-forms 1.14.0
## pip3 install stripe
## pip3 install django-countries 7.2.1
to be reinstalled before running the app.

# Deployment
## Heroku
 1. The heroku create CLI command creates a new empty application on Heroku, along with an associated empty Git repository. If you run this command from your app’s root directory, the empty Heroku Git repository is automatically set as a remote for your local repository.

heroku create -a example-app
Creating app... done, ⬢ example-app
https://thawing-inlet-61413.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git
You can use the git remote command to confirm that a remote named heroku has been set for your app:

git remote -v
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/example-app.git (push)

Before you can deploy your app to Heroku, initialize a local Git repository and commit your application code to it.
